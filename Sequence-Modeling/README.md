I will be implementing the following papers from scratch in the coming weeks. 

Sequence Modeling Papers: 

-  RNN(1989): Continually Running Fully Recurrcent Neural Networks 
-  LSTM(1997): Long Short Term Memory 
-  Word2Vec(2013): Word Representations in Vector Space 
-  Phrase2Vec(2013): Distributions Representations of Words and Phrases 
-  Encoder-Decoder(2014): RNN Encoder-Decoder for Machine Translation 
-  Seq2Seq(2014): Sequence to Sequence Learning 
-  Attention(2014): Neural Machine Translation with Alignment
